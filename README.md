# Digital Twin Project Using Synthetic Data

A comprehensive digital twin system that leverages synthetic data to create realistic representations of individuals, objects, or systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a digital twin system using synthetic data across multiple dimensions:
- **3D Human Models & Poses**: Using SynBody/SynPlay datasets
- **Behavioral Simulation**: AI-driven personality and decision-making
- **Health & Wellness Modeling**: Synthetic health metrics and trends
- **Conversational AI**: Natural language interaction capabilities
- **Visual Representation**: 3D avatar and visualization components
